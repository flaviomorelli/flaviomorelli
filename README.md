Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is __Flavio__. I currently work as a Machine Learning Scientist at Bayer Pharmaceuticals in Berlin where I am developing 
new methods to analyze microscopy images generated by high-content screening. 
Previously, I worked as a statisitical consultant at the Free University of Berlin were I worked on over 30 scientific projects 
and also as a business consultant at BCPro and PwC. 

I am a statistician by training: I got my M.Sc. in Statistics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. 
I have one B.Sc. in Economics and one B.A. in Comparative Literature (major) and Computer Science (minor), both from the Free University of Berlin.
Moreover, I am an organizer of the [Berlin Bayesians](https://www.meetup.com/berlinbayesians/) meetup.

In addition, I am familiar with Bayesian frameworks such as `Stan` and `PyMC`. I also have some experience with `Julia`, `Rust`, `Go`, `C`, and `Java`.
